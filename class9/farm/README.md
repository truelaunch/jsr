Prototypal Inheritance Practice

## Requirements

* Must have one `FarmAnimal` prototype.
* `FarmAnimal` must have `name` and `image` instance properties as well as a `talk` instance method.
* Create at least 5 animals, and at least two animals must have subclasses.
* Use vanilla JS or jQuery to create elements based off your `FarmAnimal` objects and bind them to the DOM.
* When you click on animal, an alert should show display the sound it makes (i.e. mooo!).
* Each animal element should have position styles, such as left and top, so images aren't stacked.
